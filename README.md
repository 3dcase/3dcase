- 👋 Hi, I’m 3dcase
- 👀 I’m interested in machinery design and mechanical parts design, 3d printing and openscad. Since writing this I have moved on to Onshape as Openscad was too much of a ceiling. Besides this I also build and ride motorcycles, when I have time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github and linux endeavour. Since writing this I have moved on to Ubuntu since Endeavour mucked up a few updates and I could not deal with that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on openscad coding. I have totally stopped using Openscad now so no, I will not collaborate anymore.
- 📫 You can email me on 3dcase(..at..)protonmail.com
